So, here it is, my first post. 
I have reading lately the advantage of having a blog to keep yourself writing about what you like, and it is a great way to develop better writing skills, I guess. My purpose is to write about different topics including new technologies, language documentation projects, linguistic issues in general and any other topic that might come to my mind. Having said that, some of the future posts can go more into research ideas, and some of them can be the result of traveling to interesting places and therefore leisure readings.
