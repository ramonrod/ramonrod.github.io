I am a data analyst and Python enthusiast.
Technically speaking my attention has been focused on methods for Text Mining, Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguisticc in general as well as in Big Data technologies.

I also worked as a Research Assistant at the Universities of Munich and Marburg in Germany. I was part of an interdisciplinary team, which aimed to develop automated digitization workflows for dictionaries. We also applied quantitative language analysis to several central and south american indigenous languages. My specific tasks were related to the methods of information extraction (search algorithms, indexing and Entity Recognition), but also statistical methods for Part-of-Speech Tagging, morphological Parsing and Semantic Analysis.

I spend the rest of my time traveling and teaching myself Python.
