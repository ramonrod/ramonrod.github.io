I am PhD candidate in Linguistics/computational linguistics currently employed by the [Philipps-University of Marburg](http://www.uni-marburg.de/) in Germany at the [Forschungszentrum Deutscher Sprschatlas](http://www.uni-marburg.de/fb09/dsa) and I am  member of the the research group [“Language Typology and Quantitative Linguistics“](https://www.uni-marburg.de/fb09/igs/arbeitsgruppen/typology?set_language=en).

My main research interests are in new applications for corpus- and knowledge-based semantic analysis as methods for semantic similarity. My research work focus on the analysis of meaning and polysemy as a trigger of lexical semantic information in the process of semantic change. I am also deeply interested in language typology and language documentation specially in Central and South America. Technically, my attention has been concentrated on methods for information retrieval, new applications for Natural Language Processing and the use of graph theory in linguistics. I spend the rest of my time learning the programming language Python.
